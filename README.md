# Matrix-Console
A student-made  simple matrix caculator...(i'm just a grade 1 student in college...)
And my English is poor ...sorry...

## main functions now it has
- execute basic matrix calculations(such as swap rows,swap columns...etc)
- enable users to save and load matrix
- support fraction and integar

## what to add in the future
- more calculation functions (such as caculate rank,determant,matrix pow...etc)
- support matrix_cat(combine one matrix to the certain direction of another.)
- if possible we will support reading command from local file(that is hard because i don't know how to do this...)

## main developing ideas
- To avoid using a lot of if-else, I use a "command" struct.Thus, all command will be envoked through a unified approach.Plus that makes it easier to add new functions especially there are multiple developers.You can just submit a .c file, then you can add any functions you want.(More info read head.c and function.c)

**Great.It's good if anyone could join me...simply because there are actually a lot of bugs...**
